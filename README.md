# Social Network API

## The Task

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## Video Walkthrough

You can see a demo of the app here:

In this video you will see:

- GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:
- GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia:
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia:
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
- POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia:
- POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

### Models

**User**:

- `username`

  - String
  - Unique
  - Required
  - Trimmed

- `email`

  - String
  - Required
  - Unique
  - Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

- `thoughts`

  - Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

- `friends`
  - Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

- `thoughtText`

  - String
  - Required
  - Must be between 1 and 280 characters

- `createdAt`

  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

- `username` (The user that created this thought)

  - String
  - Required

- `reactions` (These are like replies)
  - Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

- `reactionId`

  - Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  - Default value is set to a new ObjectId

- `reactionBody`

  - String
  - Required
  - 280 character maximum

- `username`

  - String
  - Required

- `createdAt`
  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

- `GET` all users

- `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

- `POST` a new user:

- `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

- `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

(I am also removing a user's associated thoughts when a user is deleted.)

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

- `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

- `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

- `GET` to get all thoughts

- `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

- `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

- `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

- `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

- `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

- `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value
